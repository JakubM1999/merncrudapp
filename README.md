<h2>IMPORTANT! When you go to this link you'll have blank page with the nav bar on top you can just click on create student or student list and it works, if you refresh the page however you'll get 404, I'm not sure why but I guess it has something to do with the back-end which I'll try to fix soon. P.S when you go to student list you'll have to wait a bit for the back end to responed it's a bit slow. :)</h2>

<p>Hello, so this is my first MERN-stack CRUD APP and for this project I followed the tutorial which was attached to materials and I chose to do that by useing MongoDB, but I also added some of my own things.</p>

<p>I found this project super fun to learn to create and deploy whole application and I didn't have much problem creating the application, I also wanted to add something from myself in this project like I mentioned before and do a bit extra to see and understand better how everything works and what would I need to do if I needed to add another line so I added "age" as another field to fill out and it works perfectly.</p>

<p>I also deployed my back-end on HEROKU and that was a bit more complicated for me but I managed to deploy my back-end succeesfilly and it's up and running as you can see on the screenshot.</p>

<p>I learned alot by doing this application and I want to learn more so I'll won't stop there, as for the skills and knowledge I'm confident that I got everything checked there. Do me a favor and create a student so I know it works, hope you like it. :)</p>
